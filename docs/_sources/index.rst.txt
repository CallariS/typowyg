This extension implements the `Trumbowyg Editor <https://alex-d.github.io/Trumbowyg/>`_.
That editor is a lightweight one with only 20kb of size unlike the usual 40kb other editors need.
It still offers a lot of features via plugins inlcuding speechrecognition, for example.

Typowyg furthermore offers a plugin that allows the user to browse, upload, select and ultimatly embed or link content from their `Google Drive <https://drive.google.com>`_.
