This extension implements the `Trumbowyg Editor <[https](https://alex-d.github.io/Trumbowyg/)>'_. That editor is a lightweight one with only 20kb of size unlike the usual 40kb other editors need. It still offers a lot of features via plugins inlcuding speechrecognition, for example.

Typowyg furthermore offers a plugin that allows the user to browse, upload, select and ultimatly embed or link content from their Google Drive.
