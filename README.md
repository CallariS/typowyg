This extension implements the [Trumbowyg Editor](https://alex-d.github.io/Trumbowyg/). That editor is a lightweight one with only 20kb of size unlike the usual 40kb other editors need. It still offers a lot of features via plugins inlcuding speechrecognition, for example.

Typowyg furthermore offers a plugin that allows the user to browse, upload, select and ultimatly embed or link content from their [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/).
